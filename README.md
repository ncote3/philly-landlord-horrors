Playing with Philly Open Property Assessment Data to uncover the secrets of the owning class.

## Data Source:
https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/opa-property-assessments

## To Run:

Make sure you have downloaded the data set and place it in the
root of this repository. The program knows it as `opa_properties_public.csv`.

This program uses Python3.


To get a venv (Mac):
1. `python3 -m venv env`
2. `source env/bin/activate`
3. `pip install [package]`

The following needs to be installed in your python3 venv (I recommend pip):
* `tqdm`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `jupyter lab`

Once these are installed simply run: `jupyter lab`.

## To Build Dataset for Site
Follow the instructions in `start_here.ipynb`.
