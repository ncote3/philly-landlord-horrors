Playing with Philly Open Property Assessment Data to uncover the secrets of the owning class.

## Data Source:
https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/opa-property-assessments

## To Run:

Make sure you have downloaded the data set and place it in the
root of this repository. The program knows it as `opa_properties_public.csv`.

This program uses Python3.

The following needs to be installed in your python3 venv (I recommend pip):
* `tqdm`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `jupyter lab`

Once these are installed simply run: `jupyter lab`.
